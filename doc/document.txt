Economics and Economics Introduction This subject teaches social scientists an overview of the overall economy they need. In other words, it outlines how economics has developed, what economics is trying to analyze, and what methods and methods it is to study. It also contributes to raising awareness of the position and importance of economics in various social sciences by concisely introducing theories and points on the development of theoretical policies in each field of economics. Specifically, let's look at what conditions of economic freedom are and what political and social structures can be embodied, and what economic inequality can be resolved in what economic and social environments. As the economy develops, expanding freedom and equality from the political realm to the economic realm is the most urgent task of the modern capitalist system, so the implication of economic freedom and equality is more important. Economic basic demand-supply-market balance market, economic welfare I market and economic welfare II companies' production technology and production cost perfect competition vs incomplete competition externality, public economics major macroeconomic variables aggregate demand-total supply model economic stability policy.

Department of Mathematical Sciences. Department of Mathematics. We learn the basic concepts of linear algebra and linear algebra. Starting with Gaussian elimination and row-to-row trapezoidal, we learn matrices and linear ideas, and define a determinant. In addition, we learn the basic concepts of vector space necessary for it, such as bases and dimensions. Understand the change in matrix expression of linear ideas according to the change of basis and learn the characteristic polynomials, diagonalization, and triangulation of matrices. Furthermore, it deals with inner space or more generally a space given a birefringent form, and begins a rudimentary cluster theory to define orthogonal groups. I understand the orthogonal groups of two and three dimensions and their structure. In addition, the concept of quantum space is introduced to enable the use of induction methods for dimensions. The basic concepts of linear algebra, such as matrices, matrices, vector spaces, and linear ideas, are studied. Linear algebra and groups. Matrix and Gauss Erasing Vector Space Base and Chapter 4 Linear Thought Linear Thought Matrix Matrix Specific Polynomials, Diagonalization Specific Polynomials, and Diagonal Decomposition Theorem Decomposition Theorem

Overview basic probability distributions such as binomial distribution and normal distribution and understand the concept of sample distribution. Introduce the principles of interval estimation and test, which are the basis of statistical inference, centering on inference in one population and two populations, and learn how to apply it. Introduce the purpose and methodology of analysis of regression analysis, ANOVA, and classified data, learn analysis methods suitable for data in real life, and develop the ability to solve actual problems. Cultivate the knowledge and application capabilities of statistics related to general statistics. Data generation - Statistics definition, significance in sampling, statistical experiments and survey method populations, probability and probability distribution probability definition, conditional probability variables and probability distribution expectations and variance, combined distribution population distribution (Bernoulli, normal distribution), and sampling underlying population. Reasoning on the distribution of significance test and rejection test) and type 1 and 2 error learning distribution Reasoning on sample test (parent mean, parent variance test problem) Reasoning on sample test (independent sample, corresponding sample, parent variance test problem) Analysis of discrete data (parent data)

It is a 2D-based basic visual design class for art college students. In this class, we learn about the theoretical background of the principle of images and learn the entire process of recording, adjusting, editing, creating, storing, and sharing images through practice. The main programs used are Photoshop and Illustrator of Adobe Systems and compare related applications to understand the overall graphic tool and the environment of use. It is a class for beginners in visual design.
Learn basic principles and elements of visual design and basic methods of creating, manipulating, and operating images based on understanding of digital media. Based on this, it explores various methodologies that effectively visualize and communicate topics, and ultimately develops individual original visual shaping languages.
The teaching method follows the following three. It learns the evolution of digital media, vectors, and concepts of bitmap images, and conducts practice through Photoshop and Illustrator, which are representative image authoring tools. Learn tools actively through practice and task progress, and explore various expression methods. In order to lay the foundation for visual design and expand expression skills, we will learn about graphic designers, various styles, and designers through book seminars.
